Over the past decade, I have worked in the cybersecurity space from the sales side of various cybersecurity and networking companies. I have since pivoted my focus over to the technical and analytical practice, where I have completed my Security+ and Network+ certifications. Using this knowledge, I have built out virtualized network's and managed to identify risks and vulnerabilities.
